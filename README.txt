Scheduling Application
By Gavin Farmer

This JavaFX application enables users to schedule, update, and delete appointments. It also lets them create, update, and delete customers and their associated appointments. All data is kept and updated within a MySQL database deployed with Heroku.

To open the application, make sure Java is downloaded on your computer (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). Download the code repository as a zip file and unzip it. Within the project folder, go to: out > artifacts > JavaFX_jar and click on the JavaFX.jar to run the program.

To use the application, enter the correct username and password (default for both is "test"). On the Main Menu, you can create, delete, and update both customers and appointments. You can also go to the Reports page to run 3 different reports on various data points.
