This JavaFX application enables users to schedule, update, and delete appointments. It also lets them create, update, and delete customers and their associated appointments. All data is kept and updated within a MySQL database.

To use the application, enter the correct username and password (default for both is "test"). On the Main Menu, you can create, delete, and update both customers and appointments. You can also go to the Reports page to run 3 different reports on various data points.

The third report counts and groups together appointments by day of the week.
